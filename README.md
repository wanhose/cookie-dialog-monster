> AN IMPORTANT UPDATE
> <br><br>
> On the morning of October 11, 2024, GitHub unexpectedly hid our repository without any prior notification. This sudden action immediately disrupted all of our API services, as they relied on files from the repository that were no longer accessible. Our team reached out to GitHub support to understand the situation, but we have not yet received any response. Given the critical impact on our services and the lack of communication from GitHub, we decided to migrate the entire repository to an alternative platform to ensure continuity and reliability.
> <br><br>
> We initially migrated the repository, releases, and open issues (excluding discussions) to GitLab. However, during the migration of issues, GitLab's own spam detection mechanism mistakenly identified its bot activity as spam, leading to our issues being hidden. Despite reaching out to GitLab support, we have not yet received a resolution for this incident. Faced with these ongoing platform limitations and communication delays, we have opted to move forward with self-hosting our own Git system using Gitea to ensure full control over our repository and services.
> <br><br>
> We will no longer support platforms that overlook the contributions of our users and the significant work invested over the last five years. Once our GitHub account is reinstated, we will set up a redirect to guide users to our new, self-hosted repository.
> <br><br>
> Thank you to our community for your patience. Your contributions remain vital to this project, and we are committed to ensuring its stability and growth in a more secure environment.

# Cookie Dialog Monster

Cookie Dialog Monster is a browser extension that hides cookie consent dialogs without changing user preferences. By default, we do NOT accept cookies (except in [a few cases](https://git.wanhose.dev/wanhose/cookie-dialog-monster/src/branch/main/database.json#L248) where the pages do not function without accepting them). You can report broken sites with a single click, which will create an issue in this repository to be fixed promptly.

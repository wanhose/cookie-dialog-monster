To ensure you're using the latest version of the extension, it's important to regularly pull the latest changes from the repository. You can do this by navigating to the repository's directory in your terminal and running the command `git pull`. This will fetch and download the latest changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local repository.

In some cases, after pulling the latest changes and rebuilding the extension, your browser may not immediately reflect the updates. This is because browsers typically cache extensions for performance reasons. To manually update the extension, navigate to your browser's extensions page. Look for a button or option to "Update" or "Reload" the extension. This forces the browser to reload the extension, ensuring it's running the latest version. Remember, this process may vary slightly depending on the browser you're using. Always refer to your browser's specific instructions for managing extensions.
